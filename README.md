### Note:  
While the web page is full functioning, it is actually served as a resource for me
to have self traininig in web front-end development, HTML/CSS/JavaScript which I'm not familiar with.
As a result the sources contain experiments and assignments intended just for a practice.

### A word about the playing engine
The introduced playing engine is very simple one, designed only to allow a feature
of a match between a player and the machine, no more than this.
The engine even don't calculate moves forword, and consist of no more of 2-3 dozens
of lines of code.
